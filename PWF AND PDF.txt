What is a PMF?
A Probability Mass Function is a function that gives the probability of each possible value of a discrete random variable.

🧠 In Simple Terms:
It tells you how likely each outcome is, for things you can count (like number of heads, number of people, etc.).

🎯 For Example (Tossing 2 coins):
The possible number of heads: 0, 1, or 2.

The PMF gives:

x (Heads)	P(X = x)
0	0.25
1	0.50
2	0.25

This is the PMF — it assigns a probability to each possible number of heads.

🔑 Properties of PMF:
All probabilities are between 0 and 1

The total of all probabilities equals 1


⚠️ PMF vs PDF:
PMF (Discrete)	PDF (Continuous)
Tossing coins, rolling dice	Heights, weights, time
Specific values (e.g., X = 2)	Ranges (e.g., X between 1 and 2)
binom.pmf(), poisson.pmf()	norm.pdf()

Suppose the average height of students in a class is 170 cm, and most students are close to that height.

We'll use a normal distribution (Gaussian) with:

Mean (μ) = 170 cm

Standard deviation (σ) = 10 cm

This means:

Most students are between 160 and 180 cm

Very few are shorter than 150 cm or taller than 190 cm

❌ Wrong:
What is the probability that a student is exactly 170 cm?
Answer: 0  (in continuous distributions, exact values have 0 probability)
✅ Correct:
What is the probability that a student is between 160 cm and 180 cm?

📈 What This Shows:
The curve peaks at 170 → Most students are around 170 cm

The curve gets lower as you go away from 170

The y-axis (PDF value) tells you how dense the probability is at each height

🎓 Final Meaning of PDF:
A PDF tells us the "density" of probability, not actual probabilities

To get real probabilities, we look at areas under the curve
