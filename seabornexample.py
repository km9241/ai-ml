It makes it easier to create beautiful, informative, and professional-looking plots with less code.'''

''' A heat map allows you to plot tabular, 2D data of some sort, with colors representing the individual values in each cell of the 2D table.
In this example, we'll create a pivot table from our original dataframe, to create a 2D table that contains the average MPG ratings for every combination of number of cylinders and engine displacement.
The resulting heatmap shows all of the engine displacement values along the X axis, and all of the cylinder values along the Y axis. For each cell of the table,
 the actual average MPG rating for that combination of cylinders and engine displacement is represented not as a number, but as a color that ranges from dark for small values, and light for larger values.
